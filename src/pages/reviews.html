          "We hired Adam Azar, and his team of professionals at Tropical Roots Exteriors, to build out a outdoor summer kitchen.  This construction consisted of a phased approach of multiple components, and required consideration of a high salt content environment. His personal involvement in every aspect of each stage attests to his dedication to customer satisfaction. His responsiveness to any question or concern, and his recommendations for possible solutions, deserves respect for his expertise in his trade.  The careful planning of the design and construction brings added beauty and value to our home, and the integrity and hard work of the entire team made the end result one which we will enjoy for many years to come. He even utilized excess materials to add a wonderful hammock stand in the lawn!

          We can not recommend Adam, and Tropical Roots Exteriors, more highly. If you have ever considered adding any element of improvement or addition to your home or landscape, don’t waste your time with anyone else… we’ve done the hard part for you!! It is a quality investment, at a fair price, that you will never regret!
          
          Thank you, Adam, for another quality job!"

                "Adam and his crew are beyond amazing. Tropical Roots does incredibly high quality, precise and professional work. We hired Adam to build 
                an exterior structure over our patio and he was top notch from day one. After having multiple companies come out and essentially throw 
                business cards at us, Tropical Roots took the time to go over every single detail. From the professional quality Autocad drawings to the 
                finished product, Adam was clearly communicating his plans to match our desires. The level of detail to every single piece of material he 
                used to build our structure to the finesse used was perfect. Adam and his team are so detail oriented that even small things like sanding 
                and painting the finished product were done with absolutely perfection. During the build of our exterior structure we decided to add 
                another one on the side of the house due to his high quality and in conversation we brought up wanting to do cabinets in our laundry room 
                and Adam even went above and beyond doing those as well. I cannot express enough the level of professionalism, quality, craftsmanship, 
                care and precision Tropical Roots brought to our home. If you're ever in the market for exterior structures or anything to spruce up your 
                backyard, save yourself the trouble and hire Adam and his team. They are worth EVERY. SINGLE. PENNY!!!"

        "If you're looking for an extremely talented, professional and overall excellent company to do business with, then look no further!
        Adam and his team extended our outdoor living space by providing a fully customized pergola, with a beautiful decorative wall, built in kitchen, 
        lighting, etc. Not only was the project completed in a timely manner, but Adam kept us informed every step of the way.
        Thank you Adam and team for everything you've done!"

                "Adam designed and installed our summer kitchen.  He did an awesome job and was great to work with!  He made recommendations to save money 
                from start to finish and kept to his quote in spite of multiple construction delays.  Adam is meticulous and takes pride in his work, a 
                refreshing contrast to many of our subcontractors on our new home build.  He and his helper, Paul, make a great team… always professional 
                and courteous."

                "Adam is great. If your looking for a great builder look no more. Adam built me a fantastic pergola. I was impressed with the detail and 
                design. Every post and header was routed and sanded. I couldn’t be happier with the final product. I also appreciated the good 
                communication when he would arrive since I had to open the gate and house my dog. They also stained the pergola with great care. 
                Everything was covered and they do an excellent job cleaning up. Great service, great skills, great communication, great clean up. I 
                couldn’t be more pleased with the entire process. I would definitely recommend them for any project."

                "I had an amazing experience with Tropical Roots Exteriors. They installed my back porch and did a great job! Adam (the owner) came over 
                and helped us design the best porch that fit our home's design. After designing, the project was started quickly. Adam was very honest and 
                kept us in the loop about the different phases of the project. His crew was very respectful and very clean. Every day they made sure to 
                thoroughly clean after themselves. They were also very respectful of my neighbors. I am so pleased with the workmanship, Adam used quality 
                material to combat our harsh salt air and was meticulous with his measurements. Everything is straight and perfectly proportional! He also 
                made sure that all areas of the wood were smooth and lacked splinters. When the project was completed, Adam made sure we knew how to 
                properly care for our new porch and has even called to check up to make sure we were still satisfied with his work. WHAT EXCELLENT 
                SERVICE!! I will recommend Tropical Roots Exteriors to all my friends and family because of the impeccable service, Adam's workmanship and 
                the amazing product we received!"

                "I contacted Adam to redo a backsplash that I had in my outdoor kitchen. He was very honest about what was going to be needed very thorough 
                with the estimate. Once the job started he was very prompt and did a great job. Also I am a very meticulous person and he cleaned up after 
                himself each day which I appreciate. Even though the job was small he treated it with care and I would recommend him to anyone. He 
                definitely will take pride in any project he does."

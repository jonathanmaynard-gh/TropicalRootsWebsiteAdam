          "We hired Adam Azar, and his team of professionals at Tropical Roots Exteriors, to build out a outdoor summer kitchen. This construction 
          consisted of a phased approach of multiple components, and required consideration of a high salt content environment. His personal involvement 
          in every aspect of each stage attests to his dedication to customer satisfaction. His responsiveness to any question or concern, and his 
          recommendations for possible solutions, deserves respect for his expertise in his trade. The careful planning of the design and construction 
          brings added beauty and value to our home, and the integrity and hard work of the entire team made the end result one which we will enjoy for 
          many years to come. He even utilized excess materials to add a wonderful hammock stand in the lawn! We can not recommend Adam, and Tropical 
          Roots Exteriors, more highly. If you have ever considered adding any element of improvement or addition to your home or landscape, don’t waste 
          your time with anyone else… we’ve done the hard part for you!! It is a quality investment, at a fair price, that you will never regret! Thank 
          you, Adam, for another quality job!"

          "Adam and his crew are beyond amazing. Tropical Roots does incredibly high quality, precise and professional work. We hired Adam to build 
                an exterior structure over our patio and he was top notch from day one. After having multiple companies come out and essentially throw 
                business cards at us, Tropical Roots took the time to go over every single detail. From the professional quality Autocad drawings to the 
                finished product, Adam was clearly communicating his plans to match our desires. The level of detail to every single piece of material he 
                used to build our structure to the finesse used was perfect. Adam and his team are so detail oriented that even small things like sanding 
                and painting the finished product were done with absolutely perfection. During the build of our exterior structure we decided to add 
                another one on the side of the house due to his high quality and in conversation we brought up wanting to do cabinets in our laundry room 
                and Adam even went above and beyond doing those as well. I cannot express enough the level of professionalism, quality, craftsmanship, 
                care and precision Tropical Roots brought to our home. If you're ever in the market for exterior structures or anything to spruce up your 
                backyard, save yourself the trouble and hire Adam and his team. They are worth EVERY. SINGLE. PENNY!!!"
